      <p>
        This application allows users to log their hours and mission work activity done either on their own or via their church. The application allows the user to enter and update their personal information as well as being able to log in and out of the application for security. The user can also clear all of their work history and start from scratch. On a separate page, the information entered by the user for their work activity is displayed in a graph. To begin, the user must enter the temporary password of <strong>"0000."</strong> After they create a user profile, the user can use their own created password.

      <h2>Challenges</h2><br>
      <p>
        The portion that challenged me the most in this aspect of the project was getting the graph to display at all and then display the correct information drawn from local storage. I utilized a JavaScript library for charts that allowed me to construct and customize the chart to be responsive and to display the data in an eye-appealing way. I had not worked with canvas elements or charts before this assignment so I was interested in learning how to incorporate them into a web page/app. Having learned this will allow me to use this element and the library I found in future web pages/apps that I develop.
