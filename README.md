# CSIS408

This is the final project I completed for my web & mobile development course at Liberty University for CSIS 408. It is a missionary fundraising log application that missionaries (or any fundraiser) can use to log donations given, set goals, and see the results displayed graphically in a graph. The application allows for user authentication and stores the information in the browser's local storage.

I only implemented Firebase Authentication to authenticate the user, but could also have implemented Firebase Firestore database instead of using local storage.

The Firebase configuration settings have been removed except for the name of the application.
