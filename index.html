      <p>
        Hello! My name is Justin Owens and I live in Texas. My wife and I have been married for 20 years with four kids. We served overseas in Ukraine and Estonia for collectively six years as missionaries with the BMA of America. I previously earned two Masters degrees in religion and divinity from Liberty while overseas that I used while working as a missionary and pastor. After returning from my overseas work, I decided to make a career switch and pursue information technology. Currently, I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Information Technology from Liberty with a concentration in Web & Mobile Programming. I currently work as the office manager/system administrator for the BMA of Texas while I am pursuing the degree. I am in my fifth semester and have 6 classes to go! I hope to graduate at the end of this year.
      </p><br/>
      <p>
        With this degree I am hoping to go into the IT field so that I can better provide for my family and serve God with my IT skills by building websites and mobile applications. I have already build several websites and published mobile apps to the Google and Apple app stores utilizing the web technologies of Ionic and React. I have found that this type of programming for mobile applications is very versatile and incredibly fun for me to do! From this course I would like to learn more about some of the more back-end aspects utilizing Node.js, Express, and MongoDB to develop more robust full-stack applications. I have been wanting to learn the MERN stack and, since I have already used React, I am excited to learn more about these other technologies.
