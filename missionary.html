    <!--Paragraph about Jim Elliot-->
    <section class="section">
      <h2>Jim Elliot</h2><br/>
      <p>
        Jim Elliot was one of five missionaries who died at the hands of the Auca Indians in South America in the 1950s. Though his time in Ecuador was brief, his legacy lived on through the influence of his wife Elisabeth and the wives of the other four missionaries who were a part of Operation Auca. Jim's devotion to spreading the gospel no matter the cost led to his martyrdom and to the salvation of many of the Huaorani people. One of Elliot's most famous quotes is, "He is no fool who gives what he cannot keep to gain that which he cannot lose." His life epitomized this quote and gave credance to the importance of sharing the gospel message.

      <h2>The Bible and Mission Work</h2><br/>
      <p>
        The Bible speaks in many different places about mission work and its importance. One of the most popularly thought of verses is in Matthew 28:18-20. The Bible says, "And Jesus came and said to them, 'All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me. Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you. And behold, I am with you always, to the end of the age.'"

      <p>
        This verse exemplifies the nature of missionary work. Jesus is the one with the authority to send out people of His choosing to tell others the good news. His authority is found everywhere including the places where the gospel has yet to be preached. Missionaries often go abroad to share the gospel, but this missionary charge can be as simple as going across the street. All believers are called to be missionaries in that all believers are to make disciples and teach others the things that Jesus has taught them. This is the believer's task.
